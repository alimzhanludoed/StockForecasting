# StockForecasting

This is full-stack application that is used to predict tomorrow's close price of a entered stock.
I built LSTM model, and trained it on the AAPL stock price daily history using yfinance.
Additionally I used Flask in order to deploy that model into a web app.


In the future I am planning to improve my model, because at this current moment it's far from perfect.

Also I will add features such as predicting multiple days into the future and displaying charts of predicted prices.
