# StockForecasting

This full-stack application is used to predict tomorrow's close price of an entered stock.

I built the LSTM model and trained it on the AAPL stock price daily history using finance.

I used Flask in order to deploy that model into a web app.

TODO:

In the future, I am planning to improve my model because at this current moment it's far from perfect.

I will add features such as predicting multiple days into the future and displaying charts of predicted prices.

Also, I kind of need a frontend for this thingy
